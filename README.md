## Introduction

BreakLog is a self-hosted time and attendance system built with Next.js. It allows you to log your workday by recording the start and end times of your work, as well as any breaks you take. It calculates the total break time and work done for that particular day, providing insights into your daily productivity. Additionally, it allows you to retrieve monthly logged data with useful insights. If you only need to track break times, BreakLog can handle that too, without requiring you to log your day start and day end logs.

## Features

- Log your daily work activities:
  - Day start
  - Exit
  - Enter
  - Day end
- Calculate and display:
  - Total break time
  - Work done for the day
- Retrieve monthly work data with insights
- Track break times independently
