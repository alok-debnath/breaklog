## Introduction

BreakLog is a Next.js project hosted on Vercel that allows you to efficiently log your daily work activities, including day start, exit, enter, day end, and break times. It provides insights into your workday by calculating the total break time and work done for that particular day. Additionally, it offers the functionality to retrieve monthly logged data with useful information. If you only need to track break times, BreakLog can handle that too, without requiring day start and day end entries.
